# ** is a power operator The double star operator, denoted by (**),
# is an arithmetic operator in Python often used for exponentiation.
# In other words, it's a power operator that raises
# the number on its left to the power of the number on its right.
x = 2 ** 3

# ^ is a bitwise XOR
a = True
b = False
print(a ^ b)  # false^true is true,true^false is true
# if both the value are false then the answer is false
# if both are true then it is false too
