# Sets
# A set is an unordered collection of unique items. Sets are defined within braces {}.

my_set = {1, 2,2, 3, 4, 4, 5}  # Duplicates will be removed, so this is equivalent to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)
# You can use the type() function to find out the type of a variable:

x = 5
print(type(x))  # Outputs: <class 'int'>
